If your Load Balancer is created using Kubernetes services, is configured for [SSL offload](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/ssl-bridging-offloading-passthrough/#configuring-a-load-balancer-for-ssl-offloading),
and you have several services behind the same Load Balancer, you will have a SSL error when trying to reach the others services using https.

Example:
- podA
- podB (`https://serviceB.example.com`)

From the podA, you want to curl `https://serviceB.example.com`, you will have an SSL Error.

To force the Load Balancer to handle all requests using the SSL offload, enable the [use hostname annotations](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cloud-controller-manager/blob/master/docs/loadbalancer-annotations.md#servicebetakubernetesioscw-loadbalancer-use-hostname)
on your service related to your Load Balancer.
